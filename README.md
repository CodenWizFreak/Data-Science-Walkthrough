## Introduction

This course is designed for anyone interested in learning machine learning, from beginners to intermediate practitioners. It covers both theoretical foundations and practical applications, helping you build a solid understanding of key machine learning concepts.

The course includes the following topics:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Model evaluation and validation
- Deep learning introduction
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- And more!

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific topic. Each module consists of a Jupyter Notebook that explains the theory, followed by practical coding exercises. Here's a breakdown of the modules:

1. **Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning**
   - Overview of machine learning
   - Types of machine learning
   - Setting up your environment

2. **Module 2: Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and preparation
   - Handling missing data
   - Feature scaling and encoding

3. **Module 3: Supervised Learning**
   - Linear regression
   - Logistic regression
   - Decision trees and random forests

4. **Module 4: Unsupervised Learning**
   - Clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN)
   - Dimensionality reduction (PCA)

5. **Module 5: Model Evaluation**
   - Cross-validation
   - Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

6. **Module 6: Advanced Topics**
   - Introduction to neural networks
   - Deep learning overview

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with basic statistics and linear algebra concepts
- Some experience with data analysis using libraries like Pandas and NumPy

No prior knowledge of machine learning is required. The course starts with an introduction to the field and gradually progresses to more advanced topics. I've written my own notes in this.

## Setup Instructions

To run the Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Python and Jupyter Notebooks

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install Jupyter, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Install all necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebooks

Start Jupyter Lab/Notebooks by running:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Alternatively, you can use 

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
